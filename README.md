#  Detection of Face-Swap Based Deepfake Videos using AI/ML

This project focuses on developing a system capable of detecting **face-swap-based deepfake videos** with a high degree of accuracy and reliability using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.

---

##  Abstract
The proposed system detects deepfakes in images and videos using deep learning models trained on authentic and manipulated media.  
It overcomes traditional limitations by combining **spatial** (frame-based) and **temporal** (motion-based) analysis to detect even subtle manipulations such as facial swaps, lip-sync mismatches, and unnatural expressions.

Our model architecture integrates **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for feature extraction and **RNNs/Transformers** for analyzing motion patterns across frames.  
This multi-modal approach ensures better detection accuracy and generalization across various datasets and manipulation methods.

##  Literature Review (Prior Work)
Several deepfake detection models have been proposed in recent years:

1. **MesoNet (Afchar et al., 2018):** Detects subtle facial inconsistencies in compressed videos.  
2. **FaceForensics++ (Rossler et al., 2019):** Benchmark dataset with XceptionNet-based detection.  
3. **CNN-LSTM (Guera & Delp, 2018):** Focused on detecting unnatural motion or blinking patterns.  
4. **Celeb-DF (Li et al., 2020):** Improved dataset revealing the need for better generalization.  
5. **Frequency-domain Detection (Durall et al., 2020):** Used frequency patterns rather than image cues.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Existing Systems
- Poor generalization across datasets  
- Sensitivity to compression and low-quality videos  
- Lack of real-time detection  
- Vulnerability to adversarial attacks  
- Limited use of multi-modal features (audio + video)

##  Advancements in Our Proposed Work
✅ Combines **CNN (spatial)** and **LSTM/Temporal CNN (temporal)** analysis  
✅ Uses **MediaPipe** for face alignment and region focus  
✅ Integrates **Grad-CAM** visual heatmaps for transparency  
✅ Lightweight and optimized for web-based deployment (Vercel + Flask)  
✅ Audio-visual synchronization checks for improved accuracy
